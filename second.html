  <h2 class="e">Controversial Roster Maneuvers via LTI Cap Exploits</h2></header>

 <main><p class="brown-border">Analysts have questioned whether the Panthers exploited loopholes in salary cap rules to stack their playoff roster - maneuvers critics view as bending the system:</p>
  <ul class="brown-border">
    <li>They used long-term injury (LTI) allowances to pick up key players like Brad Marchand and Seth Jones during the playoffs - priceless reinforcements under playoff pressure</li>
    <li > While technically legal, several commentators and fans consider this cap manipulation as undermining competitive fairness - raising the question: would these acquisitions have been possible under a stricter, regular-season cap applied to playoff rosters?</li>
