            <h2 class="e">1. Playing Dirty - Too Physical, Too Aggresive</h2>
            <p class="p">Critics argue that the Panthers' brand of hockey toes the line between intense and reckless. Reddit fans voiced concerns:
                "For the well of Hockey culture... we are all familiar with how trashy, dirty, and flat-out dangerous the Panthers have been this season and especially so in playoffs"
                "Intent to injure cannot become a standard"</p>
            <p2 class="p">Media reports also characterized them as antagonistic:
                <ul>
                    <li class="p">ESPN described their style as "trash-talking bullies" who relish humiliating opponents, both on the scoreboard and physically.</li>
                    <li class="p">A major brawl in Game 3 of the Final drew attention when the Panthers seemed to bait the Oilers into illegal hits. The Oilers racked up 85 penalty minutes—most in a Final game in nearly four decades—reinforcing accusations of inciting dirty hockey</li>
                </ul>
