# Assignment: **World’s Ugliest Website**

Your challenge is to design and build a **three‑page website** that intentionally looks terrible, while still following proper coding and file organization practices. This project is about showing your understanding of **local files, linking pages, external stylesheets, semantic structure, and images**.

---

## Creative Brief

The goal is to build a site that is **ugly on purpose** but still demonstrates clean, correct HTML and CSS code. You should pick a theme that you personally dislike — for example:

* Your *least favourite* sports team
* Your *least favourite* music artist
* Your *least favourite* place

The content must still be **school‑appropriate**.

Think creatively about how to make your site clash and look unpleasant: awful colors, weird spacing, oversized borders, bizarre image placement. The worse it looks, the better — as long as it meets the technical requirements.

## Minimum Requirements

* At least **3 HTML pages** (e.g., `index.html`, plus two others).
* **Navigation links** on every page so all three connect to each other.
* A single **external CSS stylesheet** linked on all pages.
* Each page uses semantic structure: **`<header>`, `<main>`, and `<footer>`**.
* Each page includes at least **3 local images** (minimum 9 total).
* Images must be stored inside an **`images/`** folder.
* All file and folder names must:

  * use **lowercase**
  * use **hyphens instead of spaces**
* Every image must include descriptive **`alt` text**.

⚠️ **Reminder**: The *design* should be hideous. The *code* should still be clean, valid, and properly organized.
